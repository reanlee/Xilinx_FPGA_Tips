[BD 41-237] Bus Interface property FREQ_HZ does not match between...

The answer in official forum usuelly want you to edit the FREQ_HZ of the port, but in my experience that's bullshit, never success.

Solutions below may work:
1. check clock between master and slave port, make sure they are in the same clock domain.
2. delete your IP, add and connect them again.
3. if the clock is from your custom IP, connect to a BUFG(Utility Buffer) first then other IPs.
